<h2>
Description
</h2>
<b> Impress </b> is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) framework for real time micro bloggers. Users can post content 
and viewers can see 
that content propogate at the rate of instance messages. The framework is highly modular meaning that,
although having recommended components, blogging services can elect to swap out a component for a
prefered alternative. The framework uses RESTful API and the [MEAN stack](#mean-stack).

<b>
Why impress?
</b>

We saw that the current web frameworks available today for microbloggers i. e.
WordPress were monatomic, overly engineered , and did not support real-time micro blogging. 
<b> Impress </b> tries to find a modern solution to real-time micro blogging. Simply put,
what would a platform like wordpress look like, had it been invented today using todayâ€™s web stack? 

<b>
Impress is our take on real-time micro-blogging.
